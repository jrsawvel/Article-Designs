# Article Design Options

Minimal layout.

Responsive Design.

Uses Google fonts Droid Serif and Open Sans.

These four examples use the jQuery plugin [mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl) for the sliding menus.

* [Article Two](http://testcode.soupmode.com/article/article2.html)
* [Article Three](http://testcode.soupmode.com/article/article3.html)
* [Article Four](http://testcode.soupmode.com/article/article4.html)

I prefer the **article** page not contain a menu navigation area nor a hamburger icon menu selection. And I now prefer that the header area not be fixed. I want the article page to focus on the content. The article page can contain a home link at the top and maybe a search link. The site's menu options can be listed on the home page. I'd like to see the article page kept clean.

These pages use Font Awesome icons for menu links at the top corners. Google Fonts are used. The font family and the font size for the main content area for each article are listed below. More font information is contained at the bottom of each web page.

These pages use real text from my pizza-making blog post, except that the text contained within the sample pages below is incomplete and out of order. It's not the entire post. It's just placeholder text. The same photos are used as placeholders too.

* [Pizza 2](http://testcode.soupmode.com/article/pizza2.html) - Merriweather, 1.2em 
* [Pizza 3](http://testcode.soupmode.com/article/pizza3.html) - Droid Serif, 125%
